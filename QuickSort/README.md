# quicksort algorithm

- The QuickSort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array or list of elements.

  * pivot: The pivot can be any element from the array. The choice of pivot can affect the performance of the algorithm, but for simplicity, we often           choose the first or last element of the array.

  * Partition: Rearrange the elements in the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before all elements greater than the pivot. The pivot is       now in its final position in the sorted array.

  * Recursively sort the sub-arrays: Apply the same process to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot and the sub-array of elements greater than the     pivot.

The process continues until all elements are sorted out....
