___: my UNDERSTANDING ON linkedList :___ .. // this is just basics

01.*linked list is a set of values that linked together like -> [1] -> [5] -> [3] -> [8] -> [9]

02.*each values called NODE ,

03.*you can only go head to tail like [1] -> [2] not [1] <- [2] // 
         : in linkedList called **doubly linked** you can go both side ->-> <-<-

04.*you can change the values of NODES as well


    In this Nodes:    
        nodeA = LinkedList_Node(1)
        nodeB = LinkedList_Node(2)
        nodeC = LinkedList_Node(7)
        nodeD = LinkedList_Node(9)
if you put head as # nodeA: there will be -- 4 Nodes --

if you put head as # nodeC: there will be -- 2 Nodes --
        like thta.......
